# DriverPass-Project-Proposal
This is a software design, business requirements and project proposal overview document for the DriverPass client.

The Client here, proposed in the provided documents is DriverPass (not a real client, therefore documents NDA not required, and disclosure is allowed).
DriverPass proposed an webpage URL where customers can purchase lessons from DriverPass instructors and schedule times for such lessons. 
DriverPass requested a webpage that was accessible by most main browsers (Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc) that was programmed as Client-server operations. They wanted to keep data on servers, and push it out to the URL when customers logged onto site.

DriverPass was executed with speed and time efficient manner, as it was requested to be done in a week preferebly. With that, the overall scope was done with due time with extracare put into server system requirements to maintain the server structure that can keep up with public demand. UML Diagrams were handled with care to be able to discuss and visualize the structure of the object's behavior in the programming structure of the DriverPass product.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what wouldou pick? How would you improve it?
If a revise was allowed I would revise the activity diagrams. There could be more detail in the behavior how the webpage will work as it is operated by the customer. Such as where the data is being stored, and what is happening on the backend of the system when activated.

The User's needs were implemented mainly and displayed in the UML diagram, where the Administrators are able to take a screenshot of the data displayed at a certain time from the database. This provides them with a real time over view of what is happening in the DriverPass online store. As time progresses this becomes more inaccurate because it is not updated in real-time. But overall, this allows Administrators to access data offline, as per request. This is important becasue the product should be tailored to the client's needs. The purpose of the product to provide a system that eases access and/or simplifies the process for the customer and this can be through user stories/usage cases, and uses them to evolve the product as resources allows.

Utilizing the SDLC lifecycle, DriverPass was a great project. Although, moving forward I would utilize more careful care to filter out details to a project proposal overview such as hardware specs to balance the public load.. storage? RAM? Also, finding details in certain OS's that can be more beneficial for the type of product. Do we want to be able to access it from Linux? Windows? Maybe even the browser of a VR headset where you can get behind a virtual steering wheel and learn from the website. Details in cybersecurity such as a DMZ? passwords or two-factor authentication usage? 
These are all factors that come to play. A broad overview allows the customers to assume the product will have certain capabilities but will it be implemented on the programmers behalf? or after the fact? Details should be more elaborate about what will be implemented exactly, and what not. Also budgets weren't mentioned and this could allow big gaps in the work to come to play. Budget should be discussed initially. 

Thank you for your time,
